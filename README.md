# Machine learning algorithms from scratch

This repository implements a couple of machine learning algorithms from scratch. The idea is simple; by implementing them from scratch, we might understand a little better what they actually do and how one can interpret the different algorithms. This intends to only implement the core functionality features and omits a lot of the advanced model-specific features you find in libraries like e.g. `scikit-learn`.

### Algorithms implemented

- KNN
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron


### How to setup

Clone this repository and then setup locally with `pip` from within the `ml_models_from_scratch` directory
```py
cd ml_models_from_scratch/
python3 -m pip install .
```

Each ML algorithm comes with a corresponding Jupyter notebook that is available in `notebooks/` for you to try out.
