# Machine learning algorithms from scratch

This repository implements a couple of machine learning algorithms from scratch. The idea is simple; by implementing them from scratch, we might understand a little better what they actually do and how one can interpret the different algorithms.

### Algorithms implemented

- KNN
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron


### How to setup

Clone this repository and then setup locally with `pip` from within the `ml_models_from_scratch` directory
```py
cd ml_models_from_scratch/
python3 -m pip install .
```
